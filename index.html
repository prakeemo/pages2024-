            <div class="message">I was blessed by the sky today.<br>
                Thick clouds hung in the sky, <br>and the light was very sacred like stained glass used in medieval cathedrals.<br>
                It is said that most of the medieval Bibles were mainly paintings.<br>
                It was because people at that time had such a high illiteracy rate that they could not read the Bible in writing.<br>
                There was a huge debate between Eastern and Western churches over the use of paintings in churches.<br>
                Was it because of Moses' commandments? I don't remember exactly, but Eastern Christianity had a doctrine that required the service of a single god, so it was strictly prohibited to form and serve him.<br>
                Even the paintings in the Bible and stained glass were considered idolatry.<br>
                Then the Great Pope Gregorius came forward and advocated the use of biblical paintings, and after that he could write biblical paintings, but not all paintings were allowed. <br>
                To prevent people from turning their attention to the other side, the painting strictly focused on the essence, and eventually the high-quality depictions and representations of the Roman Empire gradually declined.</div>

            <div class="message">The day before I left Germany for Switzerland,<br>
                I saw a flock of birds in flight.<br>
                As a child, I loved birds,<br>
                chasing them endlessly,<br>
                though I only knew sparrows and magpies.<br><br>
                
                Looking back,<br>
                I think I loved their image more than the birds themselves.<br>
                Every animal I saw lived on the ground,<br>
                but birds belonged to the sky.<br>
                When I flew on planes,<br>
                I imagined being inside a bird.<br><br>
                
                But I stopped looking at birds with awe<br>
                after a school lesson—<br>
                learning they mostly ate insects.<br>
                Even as a child,<br>
                the sight of a bug would send me running.<br>
                Bugs were tiny hells,<br>
                1 cm of condensed dread.<br><br>
                
                Could it be that my love for birds<br>
                was tied to my fear of bugs?<br>
                Their shared sky<br>
                made one evil, the other good.<br>
                Yet, I didn’t want birds to eat bugs—<br>
                I wanted them to conquer them,<br>
                to rise above.<br><br>
                
                What does it matter now?<br>
                Tomorrow, I’m heading back to Switzerland.</div>
